# Effective government education considers context, people, and format.

Generally, digital education programs in the government can support transformation if:

- They are specific to the unique needs of government and the agency,
- They target the right people, in the right configurations, when those people are motivated to learn, and 
- They come in a format that works for employees’ schedules and workload. 

To expand on these areas, below are a list of formats and content that we heard help facilitate digital learning for federal employees.

## Most important qualities of effective education inside the government:

### Education needs to explicitly address common challenges faced while using new methods in government.

Many of the individuals we spoke with cited a lack of useful resources that address how modern digital practices can work in government. Much of the training that is available to government was originally purchased from the private sector, which one educator said gets you “about 70 percent” of the way there. But most training programs don’t go the extra mile to adapt those courses to the government context. 
Possible topics include: 

- How to deal with the Paperwork Reduction Act when introducing user research methods, 
- How to implement new development tools while supporting legacy systems, and 
- How to transition from a waterfall process to an agile one. 

As one innovator put it, “Documenting red tape enables innovation.” Another educator said that they often share supporting sections from authoritative documents like the FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulation), so that employees can use them as “air cover” for new ideas.

18F’s Method Cards were frequently cited as one of the few examples of guidance  adapted to the specific needs of the federal government, and quite a few of our participants cited them both as valuable sources of information but also objects that they were able to share as a way of conferring value and legitimacy.

**TTS Education has an opportunity here to develop standardized curriculums that can be used widely across the government, as well as associated leave-behind materials that can be used both to promote the methods we teach broadly, but also our educational offerings specifically.** There may also be the potential to sell this curriculum to other training programs within the government, though further exploration on that point is needed.

### Effective education bases coursework on actual projects.

There is a big difference between learning in an academic setting and learning while working on a project. Many of the people we spoke with found education to be most effective when they were able to bring actual projects from their work into the teaching environment, or when the problems and solutions being discussed were similar to those they were facing in their own work life. **TTS Education should, whenever possible, develop curriculums that allow students to bring their projects and problems from work into the educational process.**

_“We had our transformation contractor come in and give some very generic Agile training as a way of intro’ing it, a lot of my staff didn’t spend the time of filling in the blanks. So we redid the training, and we kept interjecting, “They’re talking about sprint planning, this is how we might do it here.”_

### Education should involve not only the right people, but the right configuration of people.

For team-oriented methods like agile, education is less effective when only one person from the team has learned the new method. Their ability to transmit what they’ve learned to their teammates is limited, and they often lack the supportive environment that team learning can create. **When teaching methodologies like agile, TTS Education should consider offerings that appeal both to individuals and to entire teams.**

### Tailor the content to where an agency is in the process of transformation.

Learning where an agency is in the process of adopting modern digital practices can help to determine what types of training will be most effective. Agencies need different things early on in the process than they do at later stages, and choosing the wrong intervention can reduce it’s impact. It may also be that agencies follow different paths towards digital transformation and may have different educational needs altogether. **TTS could create a model that explains the phases of transformation and helps agencies find where they are along this transformation maturity curve.**

## Other recommendations we heard:

### Effective courses engage people when they are motivated to learn.

Learning happens when someone is ready to learn something new, or when they see the information as relevant to their job. 

_“There are times when you need people to go out for a week to do certificate-based training, but often these techniques are — you don’t need it until you have a project that needs it.”_

### Showcase success stories from experts.

Hearing success stories from other innovators around government can help convince a skeptical student that a new method can work. Stories can put a face to a concept and can explain how it works in a real work scenario. Stories are also useful to bring back to agencies as a way to advocate for the use of this method after the training is complete.

_“I won’t forget what Todd Park [former CTO of the United States] is doing, teamed up with the state of California, worked on a child welfare system. That stuck with me, not just because it was him, not just a story, but it worked. Doing this actually worked! Good for people to hear it, conceptualize it, not just a textbook answer. Something everybody found rejuventinating. Something like this is actually helping the end goal of saving money and doing stuff more efficiently.”_

Similarly, real-world stories and case studies from within government are useful for advocating new ways of thinking. When the student returns to their agency they may face resistance — any proof that these methods work can help grease the wheels. 

### Celebrate the successes of students and teams.

We heard from students and innovators that celebrating successes are crucial to project and team morale. Both from a leadership perspective and an educational one, creating an environment where success is promoted and rewarded helps to motivate staff and students.

### Interactive coursework is more effective than a presentation format. 

Educators and innovators use virtual trainings to expand the reach of a small team, and as a lead-in for a more intensive engagement. However there seemed broad consensus that in-person training was more effective for actually learning the material. 

Overall, we found that the way to think about format is to view it as synchronous versus asynchronous training, rather than in-person vs online training. People report learning better when there is interaction with the course, the teacher or facilitator, the materials, and classmates in a group setting. 

_“The mentor spends 15 minutes on a topic, had a few slides they would show, we used GoToMeeting—show slides, talk about the topic. The moderator then calls on each team to ask a question or describe their project. This is a key element to the bootcamp — making sure that the bootcamp is like a workshop thing, not a class. Not a passive learning environment. Want the focus to be specifically on designing different challenges, not a theoretical exercise. Keep focusing the content of the discussion around specific challenges within designing a challenge. Keep it on a practical level the whole time, which has the added benefit of not wasting people’s time. The other alternative, they would learn something, hash out their challenge at their desk — no. I want them to do it within the confines of the course.”_

### Design an appropriate workload.

Especially in regards to in-person classes, we heard that people don’t have much extra time to do work outside of class. Good training should respect the amount of time the student has given to attend the training, and remember that time has been taken out of their daily job.

_“[We] can’t read all these articles, we have our normal job. This is an extreme amount of reading.”_

### Consider certification to create incentives for enrollment and smooth training approvals.

We also heard that certifications go a long way on a government résumé. They can provide an incentive for taking a training, and help a student justify the cost to their supervisor. Several participants stated that it is easier to get permission to leave work for an extended period of training if it is part of a formal certification process. We didn’t find evidence that providing certification helps someone learn, but it could get them in the door. 

### Make content reusable and accessible.

All educational content should be accessible for anyone and everyone. In addition, content is most effective when students are able to access it both in and outside of the classroom.
