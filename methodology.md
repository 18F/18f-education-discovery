# Methodology supplement

##Process

We conducted 18 one-hour interviews with 21 federal employees from various agencies over the course of six weeks. Most participants met with us individually, but in the cases where people worked as a team we interviewed two at the same time. The interviews were loosely structured conversations based on [a set of prompts](https://github.com/18F/18f-education-discovery/blob/master/conversation-guide.md) we identified beforehand.

We began our process by talking to people leading education initiatives within the federal government to get a better understanding of the broad landscape. From there we began to talk to those who are leading innovation efforts within agencies to understand the challenges they and their staff face in adopting new techniques. We asked both educators and innovators for contact information for learners in their programs or on their staff. 

##Interview lenses

Our approach to researching this project is loosely based on a modification of the "Story Harvesting" method of data collection developed by Dana Chisnell that uses lenses, or pre-defined thematic filters, to narrow the overall exploration space for particularly broad research topics, such as federal education and training. After an initial set of interviews, we developed the following thematic filters that we used during note-taking and synthesis: 

- **Knowledge and skills employed, needed, or lacking.** People involved in pushing for new approaches use a variety of skills and types of knowledge to do so. What approaches are people pushing for? What skills do they use to do so? What knowledge do their teams and those around them need to adopt these approaches?

- **People involved.** Who is involved in pushing for new approaches? What level of leadership do they represent? What roles do they play in the social sphere, independent of job title?

- **Barriers and challenges.** What barriers and challenges do innovators encounter? What limitations and constraints do they have?
Timing. When is education effective? At what part (or parts) of a transformation process does it help? Are there particular moments or events when educational intervention is more effective?

- **Format.** What formats of education work? What kind of schedule or time commitment? In person or online, or a mix? During work hours or outside of it?

##Research participants

The federal employees we interviewed fell into five different roles, some fitting into more than one role: 

- **Educators.** Seven individuals are focused on delivering education and training, either within their agency or government-wide.

- **Innovators.** 15 people working to institute new practices, either within their agency or government-wide. Some have sought out training for themselves or their team. 

- **Executives.** Three participants are pushing for new practices and processes inside their agency from an executive position. Some have sought out education and training opportunities for themselves or their teams.

- **Students.** Two people are currently or have recently participated in education or training offered by an agency.

- **Stakeholders.** Five people came from GSA's Technology Transformation Services (comprised of 18F andor Office of Products and Platforms) and have a vested interest in the outcome of the research.

##Framing questions

To guide our research, we identified the following research goals and framing questions:

###1. Can educational programs aid in supporting digital transformation or digital services in the federal government? 
 - In what areas might education be effective?
 - Among the top practices that contribute to a successful transformation, which ones do people within agencies struggle with the most? 
 - Are those practices ones that educational interventions can strengthen? 
 - Among the top barriers to a successful transformation, which ones could be remediated by an educational intervention?
 -  Which learning needs are already satisfied by resources offered elsewhere? 
 - What other types of interventions should education be paired with? 
 - What 21st century skills do government workers need? 

###2. If it seems education is appropriate … 

**What subject areas would have the most impact?** 
  - What kinds of knowledge or skills do people at different levels of a transformation employ? 
  - What knowledge or skills are they lacking but need?

**Who should be involved in an educational approach?** 
  - What roles within an organization are likely to be able to have the largest impact for a successful transformation? 
  - Would it be better to take a ‘train the trainers’ approach? We’ve observed that there are many people already within agencies already offering coaching and training on modern best practices to their colleagues. Would it be more effective for 18F to offer training and support so these people can do their jobs better? Instead of teaching a course about HCD, would it be better to teach a course about how to train your colleagues on HCD? 
  - Are there educational resources we could offer that could help educators working within agencies into superpowers? 
  - Are there educational resources we could offer that could help turn community organizers working within agencies into superpowers? 
  - Who are the most likely early adopters of 18F Learn’s offerings? 

**When would education be appropriate?** 
  - If different kinds of training are needed to support a transformation, which ones need to happen first, or is there an appropriate order in which they need to happen?

**What format should education take?** 
  - What types of educational resources and programs do government employees currently seek out? 
  - How well are they able to apply those learnings to their jobs? Do some formats work better than others? 
  - What types of educational resources or programs do government employees request but are denied permission to attend or purchase? 
  - When (what time of day, from where, etc) do government employees seek out educational resources? 
  - What gets in the way? 

###Is there demand for educational offerings from 18F? If so, how is that demand articulated? 
  - What kinds of language do government employees use to describe what they want out of education or training?
  - How do government employees see the role of 18F?
