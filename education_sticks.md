# What makes education stick?

For education to be effective to a larger transformation effort, employees need the freedom to apply what they’re learning to their work. Employees who engage in training but return to a work environment where they neither have the time nor freedom to try out new things will ultimately fall back into their previous mode of working. Agencies must create space for experimentation to happen, which may include prioritizing (or de-prioritizing) workload, reinterpreting or changing agency policy or processes, and allowing for safe, small failures.

## Ongoing public support from leadership backs up efforts on the ground.

Being told that change is a priority for leadership is important, but it isn’t enough. Staff need to feel confident that transformation efforts are not a passing fad and that leadership will back them up when trying new things. **Leadership needs to make sure that everyone knows they are fully behind any contribution to the overall goal of transformation.** Otherwise, this is one of the biggest blockers in ensuring alignment all the way from the top to the bottom of the organization, and particularly for getting middle management on board with the effort necessary to make change.

## The ability to start small.

Another common refrain from innovators was the importance of starting small, both in terms of project size and financial commitment. Small wins provide proof that the new methods work, and engender the trust necessary to start tackling bigger problems. One innovator told us that the first agile project sprint their team able to deliver inside their agency was “the first time [the agency] had ever gotten positive praise.”

## Collaborative environments help people get comfortable with new approaches.

Several of the innovators we spoke with discussed the value of creating open, collaborative physical spaces inside agency offices, intended explicitly for teams putting new methods they had learned into practice. This was valuable to these teams, because it made it much easier to share new knowledge and collaborate across the organization, but also to the rest of the organization, who were able to come in and see what these teams were up to. 

The people we spoke with who recommended this method stressed the importance of explicitly making the space open to everyone inside the organization, so that people felt welcome to come and work there in order to gain exposure to new ideas and approaches.

## Community organizers can influence other parts of the agency.

Education can provide support to people within agencies who are pushing for transformation. “[Community organizers](https://github.com/18F/transformation-research/blob/master/preliminary-report.md#top-practices-that-contribute-to-successful-transformation)” may need more education in order to advocate effectively for their work. They  may also want to offer training to staff to help them understand the techniques and processes the they are advocating for. **Working with community organizers inside agencies to understand their most pressing issues can help TTS Education determine the appropriate educational interventions for that agency, wherever they might be in the transformation process.**

## Communities of practice are a useful extension for what’s learned in the classroom.

Communities of practice allow people to ask questions, pose problems, help others, share tips and resources, point to success stories, and so on. They give people a chance to interact with others in government who use the same methods they are trying out. This creates more entry points for people to learn about these methods and practices. 
Communities of practice can build relationships within a training program, as well as provide resources for those who have completed a training program and are looking for more information. Learners can connect not just with the classmates but with everyone interested in the subject matter, at all levels of experience, giving them support they need to continue their educational experiences outside the classroom.

**TTS Education already supports a number of online communities of practice through DigitalGov University, and should consider aligning these communities of practice with our educational offerings and building regular connection points between them in order to support learners beyond the training program.** This benefits the learners who participate in the class, but also allows TTS Education to learn  about potential future offerings, through observations about what is and isn’t working for people, or what new questions they have that come up within the community.

## Mentorship can provide ongoing reinforcement for best practices.

Several students mentioned that having a mentor who they could reach out to with questions was valuable, particularly when it was someone who had already been through the same process. In one case we heard, the student was able to shadow their mentor for several days, and observe how they applied the practices they’d learned to their day-to-day activities.In another case, an innovator told us they used a team mentorship model—connecting new teams learning how to do something with a team that had previously been through the same training.

## Embedded coaches are effective for assuring implementation of new methods.

Many innovators we spoke with encouraged the use of embedded coaches — experienced agile practitioners who temporarily join a team that is applying what they learned to their project. Coaches operate in a leadership capacity for a short period of time in order to guide the team through their first time trying out agile development. 
Based on what we heard, embedded coaches seem to be most effective when the coach has experience not just in agile, but also in coaching. Having had training or experience helps them understand their role as one of guiding and correcting the team, rather than doing the work for them. 

**TTS Education has an opportunity to develop a coaching practice to accompany its education practice, for agile development and other types of training.**

###Hiring people experienced with new methods improves the speed of implementation.

Several of the participants we spoke with discussed the value of hiring people who already had experience with a particular method onto a team that had recently learned that method. In the examples we heard the person hired was a peer, who was able to set up tools and structures for the team to use, and also work with and guide the team, in a way very similar to the way that embedded coaches operate.
