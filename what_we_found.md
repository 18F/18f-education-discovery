# What we found

Effective education is a critical component of digital transformation.

There is no shortage of education and training offerings inside the government, including education around a wide range of digital tools and practices, but not all of these offerings contribute meaningfully to the process of digital transformation. In fact, much of the education available to government employees isn’t effective at changing employee behavior at all. 

**Throughout this research, we heard about the types of educational resources teams need or have sought out.** 

**Note:** This is not a definitive list — more research is needed to to develop both this and a greater list of educational offerings.
