# What we found

Effective education is a critical component of digital transformation.

There is no shortage of education and training offerings inside the government, including education around a wide range of digital tools and practices, but not all of these offerings contribute meaningfully to the process of digital transformation. In fact, much of the education available to government employees isn’t effective at changing employee behavior at all. 

**Throughout this research, we heard about the types of educational resources teams need or have sought out.** 

**Note:** This is not a definitive list — more research is needed to to develop both this and a greater list of educational offerings.

### [What would we like to do if we had three more months?]()
Conduct more focused experimentation on identifying the top priorities for TTS Education.
Design engagements that focus on embedding new methodologies into agencies for the long run.
Explore digitalgov.gov as a way for people to self-identify their educational needs.
Create a strategy around using free content as a lead-in for paid content.
Set up a framework for continuous feedback of learner needs.
