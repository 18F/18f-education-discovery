### TTS Education Discovery Research

**_Opportunities and challenges for education as part of digital transformation_**

Across government, employees are being asked to use technology to solve complex problems and deliver better services across a rapidly changing digital environment. Much of what this large-scale transition requires is a more agile and adaptable way of working. 

Our research identified multiple ways effective education plays an essential role in digital transformation. We say ‘effective’ because most current training options fall short of enabling students to apply their learning on the job — there is a large, unmet need within government for training that actually works. 

Our interviewees identified four key characteristics of effective education – 
- **Education should explicitly address common challenges faced while using new methods in government.** Private sector training fails to address the most common barriers to applying best practices within government. 

- **Effective education bases coursework on actual projects.** One of the biggest challenges of any education program is tying the concepts back to real-world scenarios. Working on real projects in the classroom is the most direct way to address this gap. 

- **Education should involve not only the right people, but the right configuration of people.** When creating integrated services and digital projects is a team sport, training only one person on the team is less likely to be effective.

- **Tailor the content to where an agency is in the process of transformation.** Agencies at different points along the path of digital transformation have different educational needs — effective education accounts for this. 

Additionally, we identified (or validated) several content areas where there seems to be great demand —
- Programs for subject matter or policy experts who are newly assigned to serve as product owners or product managers for digital projects.
- Courses that teach people how to advocate for their work to legal counsel, policy groups, leadership, and other groups. 
- Programs that impart a deep understanding of the agile mindset, not just the practices. 
- Programs that enable people to use design processes to create great services.

We also believe there are opportunities to create training for agency leadership and other groups that impact the success or failure of core project teams — 

- Teach managers how to build and empower agile teams. 
- Show leadership how new processes can help mitigate risk.
- Teach leadership how to determine program value and priorities. 
- Offer ‘digital specialization’ tracks for groups that work closely with digital teams, such as legal counsel, contracting officers, and policy groups.

We recommend that in the next several months, TTS Education should – 
- Conduct more focused experimentation on identifying the top priorities for TTS Education. 
- Design engagements that focus on embedding new methodologies into agencies for the long run.
- Explore [digitalgov.gov](https://www.digitalgov.gov/) as a way for people to self-identify their educational needs. 
- Create a strategy around using free content as a lead-in for paid content. 
- Set up a framework for continuous feedback of learner needs.
